Your **build failed** because your Maven project is configured to use **Java 7**, which is **no longer supported** by recent versions of the JDK and Maven Compiler Plugin.

---

### 🔴 The error:

```
[ERROR] Source option 7 is no longer supported. Use 8 or later.
[ERROR] Target option 7 is no longer supported. Use 8 or later.
```

---

### ✅ Solution

You need to update your `pom.xml` to use **Java 8 or later**.

#### ✏️ Edit your `pom.xml` file and ensure it includes the correct compiler plugin configuration:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.8.1</version>
      <configuration>
        <source>17</source>        <!-- or use 11, 8, etc. -->
        <target>17</target>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

> 💡 Make sure `source` and `target` versions match the Java version installed on your machine. You can check with:

```bash
java -version
```

---

### ✅ Example: If you're using Java 17:

```xml
<configuration>
  <source>17</source>
  <target>17</target>
</configuration>
```

---

### ✅ Then clean and build again:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Let me know your installed Java version (`java -version`) if you're unsure what to use.
